Loading in all the data files

```{r loading-in-data}
daily_act <- read.csv("dailyActivity_merged.csv")
heartrate_sec <- read.csv("heartrate_seconds_merged.csv")
hourly_Cal <- read.csv("hourlyCalories_merged.csv")
hourly_Int <- read.csv("hourlyIntensities_merged.csv")
hourly_Step <- read.csv("hourlySteps_merged.csv")
min_Cal <- read.csv("minuteCaloriesNarrow_merged.csv")
min_Int <- read.csv("minuteIntensitiesNarrow_merged.csv")
min_METs <- read.csv("minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv")
min_Sleep <- read.csv("minuteSleep_merged.csv")
weight_Log <- read.csv("weightLogInfo_merged.csv")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
