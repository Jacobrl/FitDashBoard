# What is a Fitbit?

A Fitbit is technology that tracks an user's every day physical health and bodily health. Fitbit comes as a physical wearable device that an user can wear along with an digital app to sync and record the data from the wearable device. Current forms of monitoring is free and accessible to all users; if users want to gain additional analytics or insights, they can pay a premium price to access more information. In addition to premium access to analytics or insight, some digital apps offer nutritional information and on-phone workout videos from professional fitness trainer (<https://www.womanandhome.com/health-and-wellbeing/how-to-set-up-a-fitbit-a-guide-206915/#:~:text=A%20Fitbit%20will%20automatically%20track,to%20download%20the%20Fitbit%20app.>).

# Why would a stakeholder use a Fitbit?

1.  Quality of life improvements via increaseing physical activities ---Â The stakeholder within this category are individuals with no or minimum experience in the gym who wants to reduce bad habits, build good habits, and sustain them in a busy environment with a Fitbit. On websites like reddit where users under r/Fitbit speak from personal anecdotes, the sentiment of lifestyle improvement and addressing laziness are key reasons to buy a Fitbit ([https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitbit/comments/c7tqk7/im_new_can_someone_explain_to_me_what_the_point/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fitbit/comments/c7tqk7/im_new_can_someone_explain_to_me_what_the_point/)).

2.  Tracking sleep --- Users who use Fitbit uses it to track overall trends or patterns in their sleep. However, professionals advise against using Fitbit to track the quality of sleep as the metrics and algorithm used in a Fitbit does not track REM or non-REM stages of sleeping. The technology fails to recgonize that everyone's sleeping patterns and habits may vary from the general public. For instance, an individual with a sleeping disorder has a different sleeping habit from the general population which the Fitbit fail to track. Stockholders may not have access to technology and professionals capable of performing a pornographically (PSG), a test used to diagnose sleeping disorder, opting for a more affordable alternative using a Fitbit. (**READ ARTICLE TO VERIFY THIS** [https://www.internationalsleepcharity.org/blog/what-i-learned-from-tracking-my-sleep-with-Fitbit-for-two-months](https://www.internationalsleepcharity.org/blog/what-i-learned-from-tracking-my-sleep-with-fitbit-for-two-months))

3.  Tracking calories --- A feature of Fitbit is to track calories burned. An application of the feature is managing weight loss. At the core of losing weight, an individual has to manage calories. Fitbit tracks calories by using basal metabolic rate combined withe personal information such as height, weight, sex, and age (<https://www.androidauthority.com/fitbit-calories-burned-3270477/>). A stakeholder of Fitbit may use the feature to manage weight loss via tracking calories since the technology is tailored towards the stakeholder. Fitbit is useful when comparing data (not limited to calories) between the present and yesterday, last week, last month or last year (<https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/news/archive/2019/01/title-220012-en.html>).

4.  Tracking heart-rate --- Tracking one's heart rate has numerous benefits to monitor any irregular activities. Stakeholders who use Fitbit has the ability to regularly check their heart rate and identify the state of their physical and emotional health (i.e. stress levels, hydration or fitness level) . High resting heart rate may raise concerns for stakeholders and notify them of irregular activities in their heart. (<https://www.sutterhealth.org/health/heart/get-to-know-your-heart-rate-it-might-save-your-life#:~:text=Keeping%20track%20of%20your%20heart,dehydration%2C%20inactivity%20and%20persistent%20stress.>)

With the reasons above in mind, it is crucial to conduct interviews to see how an average user (stakeholder) who uses Fitbit from the general population uses Fitbit. The goal of the interviews is to better understand what information truly matters to an user of the technology.

# Interview Questions

**NOTE:** All demographic information, if requested, can become anonymous to protect interviewee privacy.

**Informed consent and explanation for the project**

The project FitDashBoard aims to explore a better way of representing and inform an user's physical, mental, and emotional health. The project's end-goal is to produce a dashboard that helps users who are using or have used Fitbit (or similar devices) to better understand and communicate a user's health.

To better understand users of this technology, the interviewer will ask a series of questions start with demographic information, Fitbit usage, and the physical and mental health. To promote transparency within the data science community, the project, interview, and data will be publicly available online via GitHub. Questions related to demographic information can be completely anonymous such as name, age, occupation, level of physical activity, and disability status. The interview should take no longer then 45 minutes.

**Fitbit usage**

1.  Have you ever used a Fitbit before? If so, what was the experience?

I used a fitbit during high school. I didn't really use it a lot. I used it for the functionality as a watch. I used the xercise features a couple of times but in the end I didn't use it that much.

2.  What were features of the Fitbit app did you enjoy?

The time feature was the one I enjoyed. When I used the exercise features were good such as counting steps and heart rate which I liked. i did not used the message feature but I did not used it.

3.  Was there a time you have shown information from your Fitbit to a medical practitioner (i.e. doctor, physical therapist, etc.)? If so, why?

No I never had a need.

**Physical And Mental Health**

1.  What is important to your physical health when you are in a stressful environment?

Advice that I should follow is do something physical. Finding a way to stay calm. Some means of take your mind off the stress like doodling listening to music or taking a break and don't over work yourself.

2.  Imagine you are 50% away from achieving your physical goals, what information would you need to achieve your physical goals?

Mindset and then keep pushing by doing the same thing again. Don't stop making progress and be consistent. External help like friends has helped me out such as being in it together.

3.  Tell me about a time where you were motivated to stay physically throughout your day?

As an example, sports I did sports in middle and high school. You want to stay motivated and become better. Better was the motivation. I was doing tennis, weigh training, track.

4.  Does counting the calories you burn matter to you? If so, how does a Fitbit device help you track the calories you burn?

No, I just need to eat more. I never had to lose weight my issue was gaining weight. The feature on the Fitbit device was there but it never motivated me to do anything to lose weight.

5.  Was there ever a time where stress effected your sleeping pattern? If so, how did you correct your sleeping pattern?

The only time was studying for a test. The excited and anxiety of going on a trip or doing something new but that stress was for one night. The resolve anxiety or stress I just prepare and face it head on.

6.  In what was do you keep yourself motivated to correct your sleep schedule when it effects you negatively?

Take my internship, I dislike waking up early and I have experience issues with being an early bird. So, I solved it by creating a consistent routine by sleeping early. It was rough the first day but now I am better.

7.  How do you define success when you have corrected your sleeping schedule?

Using the internship example, there is no concrete definition of success. I guess in this case it is getting used to it, and following asleep at the same time.

8.  If any, was there a time where you used physical indicators to assess your stress level (i.e. shortness of breath, fast heart rate or loss of appetite)? If so, how did you calm yourself down?

I get stressed sometimes when I procrastinate such as writing a 16 page math paper. It was frustrating, I don't know if anger is the right word. I was physically figitting, touching my hair, or not being able sit still to do my work.

9.  Would you ever consider using sleep or heart rate as a method to gauge with your mental health? How would

Sleep and heart rate does help. Just being able to rest if your hear rate it too high then you would need exercise to help. I was would exercise to help with lowering heart rate and sleep to improve mental health.

10. Would knowing your heart rate impact your physical or mental health?

If it becomes a threat yes, I would change the way I live via self-care. The change wouldn't drastic but small.

**Follow-up interview**

1.  Are you open to a follow-up interview?

Yes.
